          <h3>Big Data Methodology Research Assistant</h3>
          <p>I worked in a psychology research lab studying the relationship between stress and cognition. I conducted participant stress trials,
 performed literature reviews, and contributed to a research proposal on the Dunning-Kruger effect. Although the proposal was not
 submitted due to timing issues, the experience sharpened my scientific writing and critical thinking. I also evaluated diagnostic AI
 responses for quality control, provided emotional input to support algorithm training, and extracted transcript data from online courses for
 machine learning applications. Through this work, I gained practical experience in research design, behavioral data analysis, and
 statistical methods.</p>

          <h3>Adult Development and Aging Research Assistant</h3>
          <p>I assisted in research on stress, aging, and executive function. I guided participants, taught them to use data collection devices, coded
 data, and conducted literature reviews. I worked from the beginning on a project linking stress and cognition, contributing as an author on
 a paper expected to be submitted this summer. I also helped start another paper examining executive function and Alzheimerâ€™s using the
 Go/No-Go task, which I presented. This experience sparked my passion for human-subjects research and inspired me to pursue research
 as a physician.</p>

          <h3>Ana Flores-Mireles Lab</h3>
          <p> I gained hands-on experience in a wet lab focused on protein isolation and immunology. I learned pipetting, RNA extraction, urine
 filtration, autoclave use, preparing BHI media, and analyzing stains through immunohistochemistry. I reviewed research posters to better
 understand experimental design and findings. I prepared media under sterile conditions using ethanol and solution calculations. I
 dissected mouse legs to isolate femurs and tibias for immune cell extraction. This experience deepened my interest in lab-based science
 and built my confidence in a biosafety hood with live tissue. I plan to carry these technical and analytical skills into my future as a
 physician.</p>
