        <div id="DAT">
          <h3>DAT Specialist - Red Cross</h3>
          <p> I responded to local disasters, including house fires, providing immediate assistance through the Red Cross Disaster Action Team (DAT).
 This included conducting client interviews to assess urgent needs, offering financial assistance for food and shelter, and providing
 emotional support. I coordinated closely with team members and emergency services to ensure the timely delivery of Red Cross
 resources. In addition to active responses, I maintained regular on-call availability, completed disaster response training, and stayed
 engaged with the broader DAT community. On-call shifts required me to be ready to respond at any moment, sometimes during nights
 and weekends. (**31 active duty hours**)</p>

        <div id="Patient_Transport">
          <h3>Patient Transport Aide - Memorial Hospital</h3>
          <p>As a patient transport aide, I safely moved patients to and from diagnostic tests, surgeries, and discharge. I developed strong
 communication skills through regular interaction with patients, nurses, and techs, and learned to remain calm under pressure. I cleaned
 and maintained equipment, responded to urgent calls, and quickly learned hospital logistics, even after getting lost my first week. This
 role gave me firsthand insight into hospital flow, patient vulnerability, and the teamwork essential to healthcare. I saw the difference
 kindness makes, even in brief interactions, and it solidified my desire to work in patient-centered medicine.</p>

        <div id="Pharmacy_Technician">
          <h3>Pharmacy Technician - Extended Living LLC</h3>
          <p> I operated and maintained pharmaceutical dispensary machines in a non-retail compounding pharmacy. I assisted pharmacists with daily
 workflow, including medication preparation and inventory organization. I learned to recognize and understand the use of many drug
 names through hands-on experience and mentorship from pharmacists. I gained exposure to pharmaceutical operations and supply chain
 management by traveling with the owner to regional pharmacies, where I observed logistics, equipment setup, and inter-site coordination.
 This experience deepened my understanding of pharmacy operations and the business behind clinical care.</p>
