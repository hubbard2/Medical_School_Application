          <h3>President of Notre Dame Red Cross Club</h3>
          <p> I led and coordinated all Red Cross Club activities (2024–2025), including organizing blood drives, recruiting volunteers, and collaborating
 with campus and community partners. I served as site lead for the Back the Bend campaign, where we installed over 100 smoke alarms
 in vulnerable South Bend homes alongside the fire department. I also educated residents on fire safety and mentored new volunteers
 during installations. I ran in the 2024 Chicago Marathon and raised $1,250 for the Red Cross. Through direct service and leadership, I
 gained a deep understanding of the Red Cross's mission and the life-saving value of community preparedness.</p>

          <h3>Service Trip to Andre House in Phoneix, AZ</h3>
          <p> I volunteered at Andre House, a Catholic nonprofit serving people experiencing homelessness. Before the trip, I attended three hours of
 training on homelessness and the mission of service. I helped prepare and serve ~600 meals per night, distributed hygiene and clothing
 items, organized showers and assisted guests with specific needs, such as finding particular food items, supporting job applications, or
 simply listening. I also completed special projects like surveying guests, organizing donations, cleaning solar panels, and leading a prayer
 service for unclaimed bodies. The experience deepened my understanding of systemic poverty and the dignity of direct service.</p>

          <h3>South Bend Community Initiative Project</h3>
          <p>I created a free fitness program to offer accessible health support to community members who couldn’t afford personal training or didn’t
 know where to start. I wanted to share what I knew about health while learning more about the barriers that keep people from exercising. I
 posted on Nextdoor and was shocked by the response—over 5,000 views, 100 likes, and 60+ comments. I took on three clients (limited
 by time), each of whom donated $100 to a charity, and we met weekly at Planet Fitness for resistance training. I also messaged those I
 couldn’t take on to encourage healthy habits and provide support where I could</p>
