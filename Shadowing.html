          <h3>Decatur Memorial Hospital Certified Nurse Anesthetist</h3>
          <p> I shadowed Marci Baumann, a CRNA at Memorial Health. It was my first time in scrubs and in an operating room. I observed a podiatric
 surgery and was surprised by the physical force involved. Mrs. Baumann walked me through several ORs, where I observed anesthesia
 induction and pre-op routines. I spoke with a medical device rep about supporting surgeons. One anesthesiologist told me I would “hate
 my life” if I went into medicine. Instead of discouraging me, it made me reflect. I realized I would need to truly love this path to commit to
 it. The experience sparked my interest in surgery and showed me the trust and teamwork that clinical care requires.</p>

          <h3>Southern Illinois University Emergency Department</h3>
          <p> I shadowed four emergency medicine physicians at Southern Illinois University for 20 hours, gaining exposure to a wide range of acute
 medical conditions. I observed CTs, ultrasounds, and clinical assessments for patients with pneumonia, pericardial effusion, intoxication,
 and abdominal pain. I learned about respiratory interventions, the clinical differences between STEMI and NSTEMI, and the diagnostic
 process in fast-paced emergency settings. I observed the value of empathy and humor in patient care and began to understand the
 emotional resilience required of emergency physicians. This experience sparked a deep interest in the field and gave me a broader
 understanding of frontline medicine.</p>
